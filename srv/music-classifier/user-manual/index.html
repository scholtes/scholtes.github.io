        <h2>Music Emotion Classifier - User Manual</h2>
        <p><i>Meeks - Moon - Rossi - Scholtes</i></p>
        <p> This page serves as the user manual for the music emotion 
        classification project.  The project has two scopes and is thereby 
        broken into two sections. The first manual is intended for end users 
        wishing to use the GUI (the media player), and the second manual is 
        intended for developers wishing to access our API.</p>
        <h3>Music Player Manual</h3>
        <p><strong><a href="">Link to player manual</a></strong></p>
        <p>Use the above link if you are a user who wishes to use our media player to play songs matching your mood.  It contains information to help you use the media player.</p>
        <h3>Classifier API</h3>
        <p><strong><a href="">Link to API manual</a></strong></p>
        <p>The above link is for developers who wish to consume our API to extract emotions from audio containing music.</p>
